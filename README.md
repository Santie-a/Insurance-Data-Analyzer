# Insurance Data Analyzer - (CSV-Dict)
This program tries to analyze some data taken from a csv file and get some things like mean, median and standard deviation.

It can use lambda functions to apply filters to the functions based on a column. In the ```main.py``` file you can see an example.

Very basic implementation.
